      <h2>Open source within a year &hyphen; guaranteed</h2>
      Sustainable Source is an attempt at combining the best of open source
      development and entrepreneurship. It offers freedom to pursue development
      that its contributors believe in and the ease of mind that they can
      sustain their lives while doing so. When a sustainable source project
      releases a new version, it comes with the guarantee that a year later that
      same release can be used under the terms of the permissive MIT license, 
      making it fully free and open source. Releases that are less than a year
      old can be used when a license fee has been paid.

      <h2>Supports developers</h2>
      Any proceeds from license fees are automatically distributed among the 
      developers. Those who contributed the most to the sustainable source
      project receive the largest share. This allows contributors to sustain
      their lives by developing the software. To ensure that proceeds are
      distributed fairly, a smart contract is employed to handle payments. A
      smart contract is a piece of code on a blockchain that is guaranteed to be
      executed as written. No cheating is allowed, or even possible.

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    Paying a license fee is a very similar experience to doing any other payment
    online. What happens directly afterwards is very different though. The
    payments will be kept by a smart contract that will distribute the proceeds
    fairly among the contributors. To claim their share of the proceeds,
    contributors can register their contributions in the form of accepted Github
    pull requests. More registered pull requests means a larger share of the
    proceeds. Like in most open source projects, anyone is allowed and even
    encouraged to suggest improvements by submitting pull requests.

    <h2>Why sustainable source?</h2>
    We are developing the Sustainable Source License and its accompanying smart
    contracts to ensure the right balance between providing enough money to to
    sustain development and allowing enough freedom for anyone to use, share and
    contribute to the software. Letting people buy a license will ensure that
    there is an incentive for developers to create software that people will
    want to buy. Limiting the period for which license fees have to be paid
    creates an incentive to continuously improve the software.

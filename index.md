We believe in freedom
---------------------

{: .belief}
Software developers are changing the world. We have incredible amounts of
passion and talent. We can be free to create things that are important and
meaningful to us. Only then can we build truly great software.

We believe in responsibility
----------------------------

{: .belief}
We are responsible to those who use our software. We have a responsibility to
do the right thing, to make the right choices. We do not hide behind our boss
or investor.

We believe in sustainability
----------------------------

{: .belief}
Software development is a real trade, a craft that earns us a living and
sustains our lives and families. We believe we can make our passion sustainable while
remaining true to our core values of freedom and responsibility.

Sustainable Source
==================

Sustainable Source is our attempt at combining the best of open source
development and entrepreneurship. We introduce a new license and accompanying
smart contracts to ensure that we have the freedom to pursue development that
we believe in, the responsibility to create beautiful software that people will
want to use, and the ease of mind that we can sustain our lives while doing so.

A new license
-------------

The Sustainable Source License is a new license that we're developing with the
express goal of ensuring the right balance between providing enough money to
the developer community to sustain development and allowing enough freedom for
anyone to use, share and contribute to the software.

The license boils down to the following:

* You are allowed to use the software when you paid a license fee.
* You are allowed to use the software when you contributed to it.
* The software becomes open source under the MIT license when:
   * either one year has passed since its released, or
   * sooner when the developers have been compensated enough for their efforts.

Letting people buy a license will ensure that there is an incentive for the
developers to create software that people will want to buy. The software will
need to become valuable in order to become sustainable.

By giving those who contribute to the software the right to use it, we
incentivise contributions by others. Besides, its only fair that you can use
that to which you've contributed.

In order to create an incentive for the developers to continuously improve the
software, we limit the period for which license fees have to be paid. Basically
the developer community has a period of one year to create enough value that
people will want to buy a license again. Should the developers for some reason
stop creating value, or perhaps abandon the software completely, then the
software becomes available under the permissive MIT license. A different
development community is then free to take up stewardship of the software.

There might be good reasons to have the software available under the MIT license
sooner than one year after release, for instance for inclusion in a linux
distribution, or as part of a larger work that is released under an open source
license. For that reason we allow the software to become available under the MIT
license as soon as a fair amount of compensation has been given to the
developers.

Smart contracts
---------------

Because we wish to fairly distribute proceeds from license fees among the
developers, we let a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain handle payments.
A smart contract is a piece of code that is guaranteed to be executed as
written. No cheating allowed, or even possible.

The smart contract will distribute the funds based on the number of
contributions that have been made. So a developer who made more contributions
will receive a larger share of the proceeds.

Just like in most open source projects, anyone is allowed and even encouraged
to suggest improvements. The maintainers of the project have the duty to ensure
that those improvements that meet the project standards and vision will be
accepted as a contribution. The smart contract will then ensure that the
contributor is rewarded with a share of the proceeds.

Help
----

We hope that you feel as excited about this project as we are. If you'd like to
help then there are several ways in which you can contribute. If you're a
software developer, then there's a ton of stuff you could help us with. If
you're a lawyer, you can contribute to the license. If you're a designer, you
can help design the user experience. Let us know on [Gitter][1] what it is that
you'd like to contribute.

Or if you just can't wait for us to finish this, you can [donate][2] so that we
can free up more of our time to get a release out the door.

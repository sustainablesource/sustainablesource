Software developers are changing the world. We have incredible amounts of
passion and talent. We can be free to create things that are important and
meaningful to us. Only then can we build truly great software.

we believe in responsibility

We are responsible to those who use our software. We have a responsibility to
do the right thing, to make the right choices. We cannot hide behind our boss
or investor.

remaining true to our core values of freedom and responsibility.

Sustainable Source

Sustainable Source is our attempt at combining the best of open source
development and entrepreneurship. We introduce a new license and accompanying
smart contracts to ensure that we have the freedom to pursue development that
we believe in, the responsibility to create beautiful software that people will
want to use, and the ease of mind that we can sustain our lives while doing so.

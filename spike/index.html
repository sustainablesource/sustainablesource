    <p>Software developers are changing the world. We have incredible amounts of
    passion and talent. We should be free to create things that are important and
    meaningful to us. Only then can we build truly great software.</p>

    <div class="belief">
    <h2 id="we-believe-in-responsibility">Responsibility</h2>
    <p>We are responsible to those who use our software. We have a responsibility to
    do the right thing, to make the right choices. We cannot hide behind our boss
    or investor.</p>

    <div class="belief">
    <h2 id="we-believe-in-sustainability">Sustainability</h2>
    <p>Software development is a real trade, a craft that earns us a living and
    sustains our lives. We believe that we should not have to compromise our
    freedom and need not walk away from our responsibility in order to reach
    sustainability.</p>

<p>Sustainable Source is our attempt at combining the best of open source
development and entrepreneurship. We introduce a new license and accompanying
smart contracts to ensure that we have the freedom to pursue development that
we believe in, the responsibility to create beautiful software that people will
want to use, and the ease of mind that we can sustain our lives while doing so.</p>
